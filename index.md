## About Me

I'm John "Ponny" Sherwood, a software developer and entrepreneur based near Melbourne, Australia.  I've founded a number apps, the most successful being [Gleam](https://gleam.io).  With my co-founder, I was able to scale Gleam to millions in revenue while maintaining ~50% profit margins and never taking any funding (you can read the story [here](https://gleam.io/blog/bootstrapping-principles/)).

Currently, I'm working on my own comapny and building new apps as a solo founder.  I'm also taking on fractional CTO work/short term contracts if you'd like to [hire me](hire).
